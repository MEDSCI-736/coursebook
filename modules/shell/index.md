# Shell
This module will introduce you to the benefits of using shell commands to perform data management and analysis as part of your workflow. The shell offers a powerful and succint way of accessing the core functionality of your computer system, and can be used to automate data processing. You interact with the shell via the command line, typing out tasks you want your computer to perform.

## Learning Outcomes

  - a. Navigate through a file system and list files within different folders using the commmand line
  - b. Create, move, and delete files using the command line
  - c. Run programs and open files from the command line
  - d. Combine commands, such as filters,  using pipes to perform more complex data processing tasks 
  - e. Reason about how to automate simple tasks using the command line.


## Badges:

  **File System Navigation**
    ***Navigator***
    Starting from any directory, you are able to navigate efficiently to and from any other directory.

  **Creating, Moving and Deleting**
    ***Organiser***
    Using the shell, you are able to create, move and delete files and directories.

  **Shell Scripting**
    ***Born to Shell***
    Create a shell script that takes a file name as a variable, performs some calculations on the file data, such as number of rows, and prints the result to the console.

  **Pipes and Filters**
    ***Pied Piper***
    Given a folder with a set of files, you are able to find all files of a certain type, i.e ".dat",filter those files based on a criteria such as the number of lines in a file, and write the resultng list of files into a text file.
  

  **Regular Expressions**
    ***Pattern Matcher***
    Create a shell script that uses a regular expression to find all files named using a certain pattern, rename those files using a different pattern, and save the list of changed files to a text file.

## Group | Stats

Idea: gather stats on your project using commands you've learned. Document the command and the output of the command. Compose a script that outputs these current stats for you project.

This Hacky Hour should be used to start managing and organising your data using the skills and concepts you learnt in the Data Management module, using the command line where possible.

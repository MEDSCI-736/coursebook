# Project Management

The story is that many projects fail, run over budget, run over time, deliver the wrong thing.

The solution is that we review all these factors every sprint. All parties are included.

The result is that we know every sprint if we are on track and if our priorities are still correct. Worst case, we can ship what we have so far.





**stuff to get across:**

relationship / definitions of agile, scrum, kanban

agile means being responsive to change

potentially deliverable product every sprint




Set up slack



Set up trello team

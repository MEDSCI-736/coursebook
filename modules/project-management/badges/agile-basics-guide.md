Describe and discuss the four key values of Agile in a short interview with an assessor.


## Assessment Task

Here are some sample answers for the assessment task:

1. Name the 4 key values of Agile.
_Individuals and interactions over process and tools._
_Working software over comprehensive documentation._
_Customer collaboration over contract negotiation._
_Responding to change over following a plan._

2. Explain the relationship between the left and right sides of each value.
_The left right is still important, but the left is MORE important._
_eg. Process and tools are important and are great to have, can have a positive impact, but they are useless without effective team interactions and attention to the individual needs of team members._

3. Which do you feel is the most important value, and why?
_The answer may be "they are all equal" or that one or two are most important._
_Any answer is fine as long as it demonstrates thoughtfulness about the question._

4. Which of the values do you feel you could personally improve upon the most, and why?
_Any answer is fine other than "I don't need to improve any" - there is always room for improvement and being able to identify this is key. The answer should demonstrate thoughtfulness in applying Agile principles to improving the way the individual works._

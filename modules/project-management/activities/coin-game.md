## What You Need

- A stack of 10 coins for each group of three people.
- A timer/stopwatch

_Note: Use playing cards if coins are not available._



## Overview

Two teams representing Waterfall and Agile will race to complete their work and deliver value to the customer.



## Arrangement

1. Choose two groups of three people each.
2. Seat the groups in two rows on opposite sides of a table.
3. Give a stack of coins to one person on the end of each team.

## Round One: Agile vs Waterfall

Time each team and compare the speed to completion. Keep the results to also compare with round two.

**Waterfall:**
- The coins begin as a stack.
- Team members must flip every coin in the stack before passing the stack to the next team member.
- The work is complete when the final team member has flipped every coin.

**Agile:**
- The coins begin as a stack.
- Team members must flip one coin before passing it to the next team member.
- The work is complete when the final team member has flipped the last coin.



## Round Two: Change Request

Time each team and compare the speed to completion. Compare the results with round one.

**Both teams:**
- Same rules as before
- When the change request is made, all in-progress work must return to the start of the workflow

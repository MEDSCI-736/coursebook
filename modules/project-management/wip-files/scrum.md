# Scrum

Three roles, three artifacts and three ceremonies.

## Team Members

### Product owner

- Writes and prioritises user stories
- Manages backlog of work
- Does not interfere with development team
- Organises milestone reviews


### Development team

- Must ship incremental progress at the end of each sprint


### Scrum master

- Helps maintain feasible backlog
- Helps determine definition of done
- Coaching the team




## Sprint Workflow

Project is split into sprints, which need a deliverable at the end of each.

### Sprint Planning

- Happens at start of sprint. 
- Decides scope of work for sprint.
- Select backlog items to complete.
- Details the backlog (small items)
- For a 2 week sprint: 2 hours deciding backlog, 2 hours decomposing tasks.
- Create sprint backlog.
- Tasks can be assigned or grabbed at will.



### Daily Standup Meetings

- 15 minutes
- What did I do yesterday that helped the development team meet the sprint goal?
- What will I do today to help the development team meet the sprint goal?
- Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the development team from meeting the sprint goal?
- Any impediments should be handled by the scrum master, displayed on board, someone designated to deal with it.


### Sprint Review

At the sprint review, the team:

- Reviews the work that was completed and the planned work that was not completed
- Presents the completed work to the stakeholders (a.k.a. the demo)

Guidelines for sprint reviews:

- Incomplete work cannot be demonstrated
- The recommended duration is two hours for a two-week sprint (pro-rata for other sprint durations)


### Sprint Retrospective

At the sprint retrospective, the team:

- Reflects on the past sprint
- Identifies and agrees on continuous process improvement actions

Guidelines for sprint retrospectives:

- Two main questions are asked in the sprint retrospective: What went well during the sprint? What could be improved in the next sprint?
- The recommended duration is one-and-a-half hours for a two-week sprint (pro-rata for other sprint durations)
- This event is facilitated by the scrum master

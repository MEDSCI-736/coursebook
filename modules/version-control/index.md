  - Configure and personalize Git to suit your own preferences.
  - Understand at a conceptual level how Git works; how information is stored and shared at each stage of Git's workflow.
  - Create and use Git local repositories using basic tools and commands; committing files, tracking changes and restoring files. 
  - Collaborate with others using remote repositories and understand the advantages of doing so. Push and pull to remote repositories. Handle conflicts and communicate with collaborators to resolve them, using Git tools and commands.

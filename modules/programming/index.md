# Programming
 This module will introduce you to programming using R, Python or Matlab, popular languages used in scientific computing. There are many code libraries built on top of R, Python and Matlab, allowing you to extend its functionality for a wide range of purposes.  The skills you develop in this module will also be relevant in any other programming languages you may use in future.

## Learning Outcomes

  - Understand and use basic control structures in R, Python or Matlab
  - Create simple R, Python or Matlab programs using named variables and control structures
  - Debug and create tests for basic R, Python or Matlab programs.
  - Understand why testing is used in software development. Write unit tests for functions.

## Badges

  - **Conditionals**
    ***Call Me Maybe***
    Use a conditional statement to run different code based on a given value.

  - **Loops**
    ***Groundhog Day***
    Use a loop to find a cumulative or summative result in Python.

  - **Functions**
    ***Composer***
    Using Python, write a script which uses a function to improve the code structure and clarity.

  - **Input and Output**
    ***Input Output***
    Using Python, write a script to ask the user for a file to process, then save the program's output to another file.

  - **Defensive Programming**
    ***Defender***
    Given a simple function, refactor the code to increase function stability by addressing edge cases and faulty or incorrect input.

  - **Test-Driven Development**
    ***The Stig***
    Use the Test Driven Development process of "red, green, refactor" to design, test and implement a function.

  - **Error Handling**
    ***Safety Net***
    Increase the stability of a piece of code by catching and handling common errors, then providing user feedback rather than exiting.

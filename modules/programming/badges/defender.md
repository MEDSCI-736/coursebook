# Conditionals
_Booleans and if-else statements in Python_

## Description

Using Python, write a script to ask the user for input, then respond based on that input.



## Student Task

This task is designed to assess whether you understand how to run different pieces of code based on a given value.

You may use web search to complete this task, but you may not refer to your own previous work. This is to demonstrate that you can solve a task using publicly available resources.



<br>


1. Create a new script called `conditionals.py`.

2. Prompt the user to enter how many coffees they had today.

3. Respond accordingly:
  - 0 coffees: "Wow, good on ya!"
  - 1 coffee: "Just getting started eh..."
  - 2 coffees: "Hmm. About average!"
  - 3 or more: a randomly chosen response from:
    - "Whoa! Are you still feeling okay?"
    - "Slow down there buddy!"
    - "Are you sure that was a good idea?"

4. Make sure the program doesn't crash if an invalid value is entered.

**Note:** You may use the web as a reference for this task, including the Python documentation and StackOverflow. You may not refer to your own previous work, even if it is hosted on GitHub.

Given a raw data set, come up with an improved structure and file naming strategy. Sketch or create an example of this strategy and discuss its benefits with an assessor.




## Assessment Task

Using either your own project data or the supplied NLDL data available from [here](https://github.com/digital-skills-for-researchers/example-python-project/tree/master/raw-data) come up with an improved structure and file naming strategy for the raw data. That is, come up with a scheme for turning the "raw data" into "clean data".

Programming or actual implementation of the scheme is **not** required.

In a conversation with an assessor, compare and contrast the old naming and structure with your new strategy, addressing the following points:


1. A unique sequential identifier should be included in the file name, eg. date/time.
2. File naming should allow for quickly finding a specific file via sorting.
3. Sensible choice of metadata used to construct file names.
4. Sensible ordering of metadata in file names.
5. Structure of folders is clear and consistent.
6. Folder names clearly indicate folder content.
7. File extension correctly matches its content format.
8. Folder structure is as flat as is practical.
9. No whitespace or unusual characters in file or folder names.


**Note:** If you cannot or choose not to meet one of the points above, justify why not.
